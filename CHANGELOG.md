## 1.0.0rc3 - 2021-06-05

### Added

- `--s3-endpoint-url` option for targeting a custom S3 endpoint.


## 1.0.0rc2 - 2021-05-20

### Added

- Terraform config for an optional DynamoDB table used for distributed locking.
- `--lock-indexes` option to lock index objects in S3 using said DynamoDB table.
- `--put-root-index` option to write a root index that lists all package names.

### Changed

- Set CloudFront default root object to `index.html`.


## 1.0.0rc1 - 2021-05-19

### Added

- Terraform configuration for S3 and CloudFront, including optional **basic
  authentication** using Lambda@Edge and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Instructions
  for migrating from CloudFormation are in the [README](README.md).
- `--s3-put-args` option for passing extra arguments to S3 PutObject calls. Example:
  `--s3-put-args='ServerSideEncryption=aws:kms,SSEKMSKeyId=1234...'`

### Changed

- CLI arguments have been overhauled. See `s3pypi --help` for details.
- The **default behaviour for uploading index pages** has changed. Previously, they would
  be placed under the `<package>/index.html` key in S3, which could be changed to
  `<package>/` using the `--bare` option. This has now been reversed: the default key is
  `<package>/`, and an option `--unsafe-s3-website` was added to append `index.html`. This
  new behaviour assumes that CloudFront uses the S3 REST API endpoint as its origin, not
  the S3 website endpoint. This allows the bucket to remain private, with CloudFront
  accessing it through an [Origin Access Identity (OAI)]. The new Terraform configuration
  includes such an OAI by default. To keep using the old configuration, packages must be
  uploaded with `--unsafe-s3-website --acl public-read`. This is **not recommended**,
  because the files will be **publicly accessible**!

### Removed

- **Python 2 support**.
- Automatic creation of distributions. From now on, **distributions must be created using
  a separate build command**. See the [README](README.md) for an example.
- The `--private` option. The **default ACL is now** `private`, and you can pass a
  different one using the `--acl` option.
- CloudFormation templates (replaced by Terraform configuration).
- Jinja2 dependency.


## 0.11.0 - 2020-09-01
